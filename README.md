# Introduction
This project contains Unreal Engine 4 Launcher + Marketplace for Linux based systems.

Everyone is free to use / change / edit this system.
Also, thanks to https://github.com/Allar/ue4-mp-downloader this project, I was able to make basic parts for Login / Downloading.

This system is made with IntelliJ and Java8 + JavaFX.

# How to launch
1. Navigate to 'Compiled' folder.
2. Assign 'start.sh' execution permissions.
3. Start 'start.sh' script.

_PS. Both start.sh and UnrealEngineLauncher.jar must be in same folder and execution must be started from that folder._
